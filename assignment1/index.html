      A1 - Interactive Experience Research Project, Linde Hoektra, S4153614
    </h1>

    <h2>
      I chose the website Gehry, sculpting harmony. You can find the website
      <a href="https://gehry.getty.edu/">here</a>
    </h2>

    <p class="q1">
      1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
      the experience?
    </p>

    <p class="a1">
      When first opening the webpage, it is mostly an orange screen, slowly more attributes pop up on the webpage. The first thing I noticed was a piece of text that says “click anywhere to enable sound”, this text box follows my mouse movement, this makes it hard to miss after when it first pops up. The second thing that caught my attention is the moving text of “Sculpting harmony”. 
    </p>

    <p class="q2">
      2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </p>

    <p class="a2">
      <ol>
        <li> Click to enable the sound </li>
        <li>Move my cursor among the "sculpting harmony" text to reveal another piece of text about the music I just enabled</li>
        <li> Scrolling down, revealing a 3D render of the concert hall, slowly moving closer to the building while keeping scrolling. Several angles come into play while scrolling</li>
        <li>Ends with a top view which transitions into a drawing, still scrolling down at this point</li>
        <li>Clicking through the videos</li>
        <li>Went to explore the model, So I clicked on the text which says “explore the model” while exploring there where 2 black dots which I hovered my cursor over to reveal a text “explore” which I clicked</li>
        <li>Held my cursor down and simultaneously move my mouse to change my point of view in the model, revealing more black dots.</li>
        <li>Clicked on a text box “back to story”</li>
        <li>Moved my cursor to the right 1/3 of the screen to reveal a text box with “next” to skip some of the videos</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p class="q3">
      3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </p>

    <p class="a3">
      I  was mostly drawn to the scrolling down to change my point of view on the render, It was like I controlled how a video was being played. It gave me the power to choose a speed and to also go back, by scrolling up. So, I spent the most time engaging with the 3D render shown at the beginning of the webpage.
    </p>

    <p class="q4">
      4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </p>

    <p class="a4">
      I was mostly scrolling up and down, next to that I spend a lot of time
      moving my cursor to reveal text boxes and clickable options.
    </p>

    <p class="q5">
      5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </p>

    <p class="a5">
      I believe the primary goal of this experience is to give a preview of what it would feel like to visit the concert hall, while educating/ inspiring the visitor about the creative design process of the concert hall. 

It starts with the 3D render of the place, while an example of the music is constantly playing in the background, you are slowly introduced to more and more interactive parts of the design process. Allowing you to get to know the building, and slowly immerse you in the space. With a lot of interactive elements present it feels like an exploration into the building (encouraging a visit there) and into the mind of Gehry (educating you about the design).

    </p>

    <p class="q6">
      6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </p>

    <p class="a6">
      It is mainly communicated through the setup of the webpage. It is divided into several chapters, explaining several components of the design process (education). In each chapter there are models to explore and a lot of pictures/ videos showing how attending a concert would look like. With videos of the architect, Frank Gehry, talking about the process. So, the communication is through webpage structure and mixed media interaction. 
    </p>

    <p class="q7">
      7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </p>

    <p class="a7">
      I think this is meant as a linear interaction, meaning that you start at the top of the page, and slowly work your way down through the chapters. On the visitors own tempo. One could choose to watch all the videos and explore all the models in full detail (estimated time 1,5-2 hours), or skim through the chapters and take a glance at a little bit of everything (estimated time 30 mins). It feels more like a one visit webpage due to the linear nature of having to scroll down to the new information. On the other hand, all the different interactions encourage you to explore. The menu placed on top of the page, makes it easier to come back to certain parts for a second/third/fourth/etc. visit. This would particularly be of use for Architects (students, workers and educators) and classical music enthusiasts/ players.
    </p>

    <p class="q8">
      8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </p>

    <p class="a8">
      It starts with the prompt “scroll for story”, once you keep scrolling down the story, small pieces of text start to show. Such as “explore the model”. The letters move, once the cursor hovers above it and a picture of the model shows, which indicates you have to click on the text. 

Once you get to the videos, in the bottom middle there is a pause button, and an indication of which video you are on. When moving the cursor to the left/right third of the screen a text box pops up, showing either prev/next, indicating you to click to go to another video. 

In conclusion, the communication about interaction is mainly scroll based, text pop ups (visual), labeling and movement of text. When doing a repeat visit, the website does not remember where you ended the visit. It brings you to the start each time you visit. 

    </p>

    <p class="q9">
      9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </p>

    <p class="a9">
      a.	Sketches (paper and digitalized)
      b.	Architectural models (several materials)
      a.	Both in pictures and digitalized to explore
      c.	3D renders
      d.	Video’s 
      e.	Photos 
      f.	Music 
      g.	Anecdotes/ quotes
      h.	Portfolio/ book like setup
      
    </p>

    <p class="q10">
      10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>

    <p class="a10">I believe the site acts to mimic an exhibition or portfolio book. Where one can wander through the chapters to learn more about the building and design process. In the end, the visitor built up knowledge and explored the building piece by piece. Going through all the stages of the project in a fast comprehensive manner. </p>

    <p class="q11">
      11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
      feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>

    <p class="a11">Due to the explorative nature of the website, I had the feeling of being curious about the design/ the process/ the way Gehry works in a project. With this also comes the act of being patient, the website requires a lot of scrolling and clicking though videos in order to go to the next section. This means that if I quickly want an answer to one of my questions there is a big possibility I would get a bit frustrated, since it is hard to quickly find a specific piece of information. When in an adventurous, explorative mindset the website will give you a lot of surprises and inspiration for your own projects. There is an accessible version of the site, but this took me a while to find.</p>

    <p class="q12">
      12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </p>

    <p class="a12">
      The scroll based linear storyline makes it great for exploration. While having a quick look at the website is quite difficult. It takes quite some scrolling before you get to the information. Sometimes my laptop took a while to skip through the videos (RMIT internet connection), making the website not suitable for quick fast interactions, which can become annoying when trying to find 1 piece of information. The linear story set up is a restricting factor on the website. 
    </p>

    <p class="q13">
      13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?
    </p>

    <p class="a13">
      I found 2 interactions really satisfying, they were at the start of the webpage. The first one being the text flowing in the movement of my cursor, revealing a text about music. I started to play a game with myself to make the text read as fun/ unusual as possible. It never became impossible to read, since the words would not stack on to each other (unless following the same path twice), and disappear after a certain amount of movement. Which made it not to cluttered. 

Right after, when you first start scrolling down, the video of the 3D render plays based on your scrolling movement. The speed of it flows really nice and it gives you a great start by seeing the full concert hall from different angles. This scrolling/video playing interaction comes back several times throughout the chapters. However, the first one really catches your attention, the length of each angle is short enough to keep it interesting, but long enough to see all the amazing shapes in the building. It ends with a smooth transition into the sketch. Which gives it a clear ending.
